This is an original binary copied from an old (working) dub siren.

Recent reports of the hosted code not functioning properly have led me to do this - so whatever changes happen in the Arduino IDE, this should alway work.

The image.bin file can be written to the Arduino Due using bossac.exe and the native USB port.
