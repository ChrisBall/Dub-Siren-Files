####Other parts required that are not included in the above list:

1 x Motherboard standoff screw 		(someone you know will have one of these)

1 x M3x20 screw				(check ebay. Can be purchased from farnell but in packs of 100)

Ribbon Cable 				(recycled from old IDE cables is fine)

1 x 10K ohm resistor			(most resistor kits will have these, this should be matched to the LED - I use 10k to severely limit brightness)

1 x 470 ohm resistor			(most resistor kits will have these)

1 x A4 laser grade 3mm plywood, cut  	(most laser cutting services should be able to take the .svg files given)


####Notes:

The A10K Pots given in the list above have not yet been tested in situ.
